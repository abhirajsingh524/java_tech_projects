# ðŸš† Railway Registration System (Java Project)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
The **Railway Registration System** is a Java-based console application designed to demonstrate the **four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** â€” *Encapsulation*, *Inheritance*, *Polymorphism*, and *Abstraction* â€” through a real-world scenario of booking railway tickets and managing passengers, trains, and stations.

This project is ideal for students and beginners looking to understand the application of OOP concepts in Java.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
- To simulate a **railway booking system** with multiple stations, trains, and passengers.
- To apply **all four OOP principles** in a single integrated project.
- To enhance understanding of **class relationships**, **data hiding**, and **method overriding**.
- To build a **modular and maintainable system** for further expansion.

## ðŸ§± Core Features
âœ… Passenger Registration  
âœ… Train and Station Management  
âœ… Booking Creation and Retrieval  
âœ… Object-Oriented Architecture  
âœ… Extendable Design for Future Features (e.g., Transport Integration, Payment, Schedule Tracking)

## ðŸ§© System Architecture

The system consists of three main Java files:

### 1. **Person.java**
- Represents passengers and other individuals interacting with the system.
- Demonstrates **Encapsulation** through private fields and getters/setters.

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String gender;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}
